# OpenRCT2 Bench Builder

An [OpenRCT2][] Plug-in that builds benches, litter bins, and footpath fences of your choices on
all tiles by one click.

## Acknowledgements

This plug-in is based on [Benchwarmer] of [tubbo] and [Scenary-Manager] of [Sadret].

## Installation

Download the latest [release] from Github. Place the `Bench-Builder.js` in the `plugin` subfolder
of your OpenRCT2 user directory. On Windows, `C:Users\{User}\Documents\OpenRCT2\plugin`.

## Usage

Click on "Bench Builder" in the Map menu in the toolbar in game. From there you can choose which
bench/bin/fence you want to build. Fences will only be placed on flat tile with a footpath in
current version.

## Future Development

- Allows fence placement on sloped terrain.
- Whatever you suggest.
